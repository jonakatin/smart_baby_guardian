üõ°Ô∏è Smart Guardian
Smart Guardian is an Android IoT companion app built with Flutter and Kotlin. It connects to an ESP32 microcontroller over Bluetooth to monitor safety conditions detecting dangerous temperature, proximity, or fire-related anomalies and alerting users instantly.

Project Description
The Smart Guardian system enhances laboratory safety by combining embedded sensing and mobile monitoring.
It integrates:
‚Ä¢ A temperature sensor (DS18B20) for heat detection
‚Ä¢ An ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) for proximity alerts
‚Ä¢ Optional tilt or vibration sensor for movement detection

Whenever an unsafe event occurs like extreme heat, close proximity, or a possible fall the app triggers alerts (sound, vibration, flashlight, and on-screen warnings) and logs data locally for review.
