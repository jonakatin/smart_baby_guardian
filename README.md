üõ°Ô∏è Smart Baby Guard
Smart Baby Guard is a Flutter companion app for the SmartBabyGuard ESP32 firmware. It connects over Bluetooth Classic to stream temperature and distance data, trigger audible/visual/vibration alerts, and store historical readings locally.

Project Description
The Smart Baby Guard system keeps infants safe by combining embedded sensing and mobile monitoring.
It integrates:
‚Ä¢ A temperature sensor (DS18B20) for heat detection
‚Ä¢ An ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) for proximity alerts
‚Ä¢ Bluetooth Classic connectivity via the SmartBabyGuard device

Whenever the ESP32 reports dangerous temperature or close distance values, the app raises alarms (sound, vibration, flashlight, and on-screen warnings) and logs data locally for review.
